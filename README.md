### Cross stitch tools for patterns drafted in Excel

## [Download XstitchXcel Here](https://github.com/rmcrackan/XstitchXcel/releases/latest)

### Requirements: Windows with Excel installed

These are a few DMC-centric tools for converting a drafted cross stitch design made in Excel into a full printable pattern. A few example xlsx files are also included.

The first time you use any of these tools with your design, you'll see it get opened in Excel so we can analyze it. This analysis is then saved in a file so it doesn't have to happen again. This initial step will run again anytime your excel file is changed.
